# covid-19-hackathon

Goal: Come up with ideas and build applications to help the communities in tackling Covid-19 crisis. [Sign up form](https://forms.gle/63vGECLE9yDiDE5j6)

### Add Your Ideas Below

1. Proposed by Wei Shung Chung: Realtime monitoring of temperature. A way to proactively monitor the temperature of everyone and show a heatmap. Build a REST API to accept geo location and temperature. Users can submit via their phones/web. Users do not need to login. Consider using Twitter.

2. [Quick Start Covid-19 Cases Data Exploration Colab Notebook](Covid_19_Data_Exploration.ipynb) Proposed by Jared Yu: Determine the spread of the disease. For example, I think there are some best/worse case scenarios to consider per country/globally. I think the growth in some places like Italy, Iran, and S. Korea have surprised people. Also try to rank country preparedness and see which countries are in need and what can be done.

3. Proposed by Mennatullah Siam: Build maps for potential places for the spread of the virus. In Seattle it was mainly seniors and in general it was found people with less immune system. So if there is a way we can crawl based on locations of hospital/senior homes/ but also proximity to previous places with infections and tracks of each individual found with a virus + amount of time taken to actually have that virus. Building this heatmap might help them trackdown the virus better not sure the applicability though of the idea.  I am guessing already govt in developed countries are doing that. The problem is that these tools are probably private. Community effort to build this open source tool will help underdeveloped countries much more at least as warnings for citizens with lower immune system to stay away from these potential places. 

4. [Where-To-Buy Project Page](https://aiformankind.github.io/where-to-buy/) Proposed by Wei Shung Chung: Can someone tell me where I can find a mask and any essential items during outbreak/quarantine ? A website driven by communities to post/share infos about the availability of items (Suggested by Anna)

5. Proposed by Wei Shung Chung: A way for parents to know who is sick in the daycare/school. Need more infos and visibility.

6. Proposed by Wei Shung Chung: Scan latest papers about Covid-19 from NEJM, JAMA, Lancent, etc and provide summaries of the papers. Find out the treatment plans per individual types (Suggested by Anna).

7. Proposed by Sambit Das. Handle misinformation

8. Proposed by Aruj Mahajan: Build a knowledge graph aggregating infos from wikipedia, JHU Covid-19 cases dataset and other data sources.

9. Understand and find out more infos about the risk to pregnant women.

10. Proposed by David Selinger: Work on Covid-19 Primers Design: [Technical Problems with Existing CDC COVID-19 Primers, and an Improved Set of Primers](https://tomeraltman.net/2020/03/03/technical-problems-COVID-primers.html?fbclid=IwAR0sxmqGJ74GQfjQw3tclmTPl-LLrL5V63aPBv5XkxAwtGZ11GBNsMWD1Qc)

11. Proposed by Anna T and Jean-Philippe Monfet: Tracking those who might have come into contact with a newly confirmed case or suspected case, etc

12. Proposed by Anna T: Mobile health project that helps people to keep track of their health conditions, e.g. vital signs, symptoms etc.

13. Train a CT Scan model to diagnose Coronavirus.

14. Proposed by Abhay Agarwal : Develop a mobile application to track locations and path taken by people to reach any destination. Application will raise a red flag advising not to take particular path and in case if somebody is infected but clinically not yet confirmed so at least we can know their travel history to identify other people.

15.Porposed by Avinash :  pre Travel screening self ceritifed qurantinite apporved by a local doctor  , ensure safer travel and reduce fear and make travel safer
